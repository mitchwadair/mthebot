# What is MtheBot_?
MtheBot_ is an open-source project by [Mitchell Adair](https://github.com/mitchwadair), aiming to build an easy-to-use chat bot for Twitch.  Chat bots on Twitch help to provide a rewarding and engaging experience for a broadcaster's viewers. In order to provide such an experience, often times a broadcaster must do a lot of additional work and research to allow for complicated commands to work in their chat. The goal of MtheBot_ is to minimize the amount of extra work a broadcaster must to in order to provide their chat with an enjoyable experience.  The project started as a way to make a uniquely customizable bot for my own [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/mtheb_). I quickly realized that I could generalize the bot and make it available for other people to use as well.

# How can I support MtheBot_?
MtheBot_ is currently a one-man operation.  Because of this, I incur numerous monthly costs associated with keeping the bot running, which I currently pay out of pocket.  These costs include domain registration and maintenance, server architechture, and more.  If you would like to help keep MtheBot_ running, you could consider supporting the project on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/mitchwadair) or giving a one-time donation through [PayPal](https://paypal.me/mitchwadair). Anything is appreciated and will directly help the efforts being made not only to maintain MtheBot_, but also to allow me to dedicate more time to improving the bot and it's features.

MtheBot_ is built using [tmi.js](https://tmijs.com/) and [TESjs](https://tesjs.net/).  The back-end is built using a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to host an API which serves the [MtheBot_ user portal](https://bot.mtheb.tv).
